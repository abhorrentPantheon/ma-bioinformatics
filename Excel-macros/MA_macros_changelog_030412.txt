New:
====

clear_nonsig_fl, clear_nonsig_ov
--------------------------------
These both remove the highlighting from cells that are not bold (i.e. fail
the 0.05 significance test) from the Folds or Overview sheets.

Updated:
========

resp2calcvals
-------------
Now produces a logResponses sheet after the Responses sheet and before the 
CalcVals sheet. CalcVals t-tests are performed on the logResponses values, not
the Responses as previously.

************************************
* MA_macros Changelog: 06 May 2011 *
************************************

New:
====

iqr_flag
--------
Highlights outliers within a group for all metabolites on the Responses 
sheet. Currently flags those with a value outside of 1.5 times the 
inter-quartile range.

New:
====

import_multi_csv
----------------
Running this creates a new workbook, then asks you to select .csv files.
These are then used to populate the workbook, using the file name as the
sheet name.

calc2end
--------
Asks whether there are duplicate metabolites, and based on this runs
either emboldT_pretty or emboldT_pretty2, then calc2oview, dupRem if there
are duplicate metabolites, copies the Overview sheet, runs fold_colour_ov
(which itself runs neg_folds_ov) then oview2folds. Basically, given a 
checked CalcVals sheet, it will produce all the other downstream sheets.

Updated:
========

Tidied up formatting.
Removed macros that were specific for Xcalibur-processed (Thermo) files.

cpd_sort
--------
Changed from checking the last few characters of the names to using a
dictionary of compounds. If compounds are put into the 'Other compounds'
category, add the compound name to the appropriate list in the code (there
are instructions in the comments in the code as well).

************************************
* MA_macros Changelog: 02 Mar 2011 *
************************************

Updated:
========

Documentation now includes how to fix 'Compile error: User-defined type 
not defined' error.

neg_folds_ov
------------
(and hence fold_color_ov)
Macro now does not change the standard deviation values to the negative
inverse as it was previously.

************************************
* MA_macros Changelog: 22 Feb 2011 *
************************************

New:
====

resp2calcvals
-------------
Macro creates the CalcVals sheet from the Responses sheet.
Requires that the Responses sheet has group information in row 4 (see
gcms-template.xls for layout).

Updated:
========

calc2ov
-------
Macro now does not ask how many sample groups there are, it calculates it 
from the size of the sheet.

(all macros)
------------
Cleaned up and standardised layout, info etc.

Accompanying files:
===================

gcms-template.xls
-----------------
Now only 2 sheets.
Responses tab now has Group row (row 4) for the creation of CalcVals sheet.

gcms-example.xls
----------------
Updated for consistency.
