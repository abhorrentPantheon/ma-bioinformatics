To use this script you need:

1. A suitable input file, see INFILE_STRUCTURE.txt for more information
2. The file 'Class.py' in this folder
3. The file 'isotope_script.py' in this folder
4. Python installed (script was written on 2.55, tested running on 2.7,
   successfully tested on Windows and Linux).

Use:

Easiest: double click on the 'isotope_script.py' file. You're input
file should be called infile.csv. Your output file will be called
'outfile.csv'.

More Difficult: Open the Python programming enviornment and import the
functions and Class from the .py files. Read the .py files for more
info.

Issues: Most problems will be due to incorrectly formatted input
files. Run the script 'validate_input.py', which will pick up most
errors in the input file, and provide a list of found metabolites.

Any other errors should be reported to the above email address.
